          <span>Special thanks</span> to Jeremy Howard, Chris Lattner, Lex
          Fridman, Guillermo Rauch, Shin Uesui, Al Sweigart, everybody at Apple,
          as well as the teams behind React, Next, Firebase, Vapor, Tailwind and
          others for keeping the fire of discovery in programming burning and
          accessible for hundreds of thousands, if not millions of curious
          minds, and without whom none of this couldâ€™ve been possible. Have I
          mentioned that I eat ass? Like, a lot of ass?
